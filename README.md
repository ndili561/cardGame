# Homework

This weekend's homework is to extend your code on dealing cards to players to implement the rules of a card game.

The card game we would like you to implement is 3 Card Brag (the rules of which can be found [here](http://www.playbrag.com/hand-rankings-and-odds/) ). Betting is NOT required, and a 2 player version is just fine. 

Think about the logic you would need to find the winning player and how to compare hands. Feel free to play the game to get familiar with it!

Remember to use TDD, writing appropriate tests.

##Extension

IF YOU ARE REALLY AMBITIOUS then you can think about adding betting to the game (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_card_brag) for how betting works).
